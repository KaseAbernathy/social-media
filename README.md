# social-media

This is my personal project that I made in order to emulate a social media website. The functionailty that it covers are: UserName and Password login, new user sign-up,
a homepage where personal posts can be created/edited/deleted, friends' page and friend requests, ability to see other friends' posts, and the ability to send messages 
to other users. The back-end was set up using Express.js. The front-end was set up using plain vanilla HTML and CSS. All of the data that is passed into the program is
stored in a Postgres database on my local machine. Because of this, extensive use of SQL queries are used in the program. Authorization is handled by passing cookies 
back and forth between the front-end and back-end to make sure the user has permission to do whatever they are doing. I made this project to practice my skills in web
development as well as display them to the public.
